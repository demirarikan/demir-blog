I'm Demir, a computer science Masters student at [TUM](https://www.cit.tum.de/en/cit/home/). 

I'm currently visiting JHU to work with [Prof. Iordachita](https://amiro.lcsr.jhu.edu/) on improving the accurary of autonomous robotic subretinal injections using OCT imaging. Before that I worked at [iThera](https://ithera-medical.com/) as a software developer working on a MSOT image analysis and reconstruction software and as a QA speiclist at [Quickbird Studios](https://quickbirdstudios.com/).

I am interesed in application of AI/ML, particularly in medicine. Here you can find more about my projects, writings and whatever else I feel like sharing.
