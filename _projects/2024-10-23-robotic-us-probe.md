In ultrasonic thyroid scans the ultrasound (US) probe is pressed against the patients neck. In this project me and my friend Sinan tackled the first step of this procedure, placing the probe on the neck automatically. For this project we used the KUKA iiwa 6 DoF robotic arm in combination with the Intel realsense RGB-D camera. 

This was also my first experience with 3D printing, designing and printing a camera holder for the other 3D printed US probe end effector of the robotic arm.
